# The NOM-Ination - Naaka's Nom System
A simple implementation of bellies for ss13 that allows for stuffing, endosoma, preg/chubby cosmetic bellies, etc, using a robustly-sprited and robustly-layered setup.

Sounds are sourced from CHOMPStation 2, the Starbound Simple Vore Mod, BubberStation's vore sounds, and "Belly Speak" from Freesound; see the attributions file in the sounds subdirectory.

Sprites are my own creations.  Do not use them or any of the systems here to implement fatal vore.  I'm watching you.
